# CMRenderer

This project is a rendering framework I am implementing in C++ to learn graphics programming in depth. I have plans for portability, but the project is currently only buildable on Windows, and with MSVC bias.

The project also current relies heavily on D3D11, and will terminate at runtime if not supported. Dependencies are currently expected to be present.

## Prerequisites:
- A compiler supporting C++20.
- Premake5 (or optionally CMake with a version of 3.31 or higher).
- Graphics drivers that support DirectX 11. (See *[How to determine the version of DirectX by using the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-determine-the-version-of-directx-by-using-the-directx-diagnostic-tool-0c21cbce-55dc-2f9c-d3b1-f966c8339906#:~:text=Click%20Start%2C%20and%20then%20click,information%20for%20each%20DirectX%20file.)*)
- A *Windows* operating system.

## Note:
This project may not fully support a wide variety IDE's, and is not currently guaranteed to be portable.
You may need to update the project's *premake5.lua* or *CMakeLists* to fit your desired needs.

## Installing:
This project relies on various submodules (currently only DirectXTK)
which *must* be cloned alongside the base repository.

To clone the repository:
```
git clone --recursive-submodules [this-repository-url]
```

Or if the repository has already been cloned:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building (Premake):
Assuming Premake5 is installed and added to path (or the Premake5 .exe is present), you can generate
a project file by going to the root directory of the repository where the project's premake5.lua is
present and running:
```
premake5 [your-generator-here] (ie, vs2022, etc)
```
From here you can build the project using your IDE of choice.

## Building (CMake)
Alternatively, if you wish to use CMake you can generate a project file by running:
```
cmake -S . -B build -G "[your-generator-here]"
```
Note: if you wish to use a generator other than Ninja (which is used by default in this project)
with Visual Studio's CMake integration, I recommend you also update the *"generator"* fields for
each configuration in *CMakeSettings.json* from *"Ninja"* to your desired generator.

From here you can build using your IDE of choice, or invoke CMake by running:
```
cmake --build build
```

Side note: Instead of using CMake to generate a .sln file for Visual Studio, I'd recommend using
Visual Studio's native CMake integration by right-clicking on the project's folder and clicking *"Open With Visual Studio"*.
