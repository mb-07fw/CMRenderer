# CMRenderer

This project is a rendering framework I am implementing in C++ to learn graphics programming in depth. I have plans for portability, but the project is currently only buildable on Windows, and with MSVC bias.

The project also current relies heavily on D3D11, and will terminate at runtime if not supported. Dependencies are currently expected to be present.
